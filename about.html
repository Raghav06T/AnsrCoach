Established in 2020 to provide education to poor children, Our Children Charity has grown in both scope and scale, with programs today reaching children and youth across the country.<br><br>
    As one of the largest non-governmental organizations in the country, Children Charity focuses on high-quality, low-cost and replicable interventions to address gaps in the education system. Working  directly with children and youth as well as through large-scale collaborations with government systems, Children Charity programs reach millions of lives every year. Children Charity's Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) approach has demonstrated proven impact on children's learning outcomes and is now being adapted to contexts outside India.</p>
